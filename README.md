# vehicle-control-system-using-CAN-protocol


This project was my final year mega project  which I have been working on for 1 year. This project is all about implementation of CAN protocol which is very important protocol in embedded system. there are two controllers through which we can manipulate sensors and fetch data. one of the microcontroller acts as a master and other act as a slave. The communication between microcontrollers and sensors is establish by CAN bus. There are total 5 sensors through we can assess the whole system.  to reduce the complexity of the wire and to get a quick response from sensors CAN protocol is used in modern vehicles. It communicate between various sensors.
